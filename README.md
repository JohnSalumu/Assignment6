**Hospital Appointment
Maker**

This is an ongoing
project for my Applications Development Practice 3 subject.

The aim of this
application is to allow employees of a specific company who are in partnership
with a specific hospital to be able to make appointments with their doctors
online using this app without having to personally go to the hospital.

**Application
description:**

Given an initial setup
(defined in the " **Signing up** "
tab), the application will allow the user to make an appointment with their
doctor. ("**make an appointment** "
tab).

For the better running
of the application, events will be occurring one after another as per the description
in the following points.

The application will
work in different phases making the most important parts of the functionality
of the application: 

- **Signing
     up**: the person willing to use the
     application for the very first time, will have to sign up to the application
     and get granted necessary credentials (username and password) for logging
     in.
- **Logging
     in**: credentials granted, the user
     will be able to login by filling in the information required to him on the
     login screen. Once that is validated, they will either be directed to the
     doctor’s menu or to the patient’s menu as per what they stated when
     signing up.
- **Employee
     MENU**: on their menu, the employees
     will be able to:

- *  make
an appointment by checking doctor’s profiles and choosing their
available time slot: date & time

- * Log out and log out from the application if needs be. 

- **Doctor’s menu:**
     Here the doctor will be able to:

- * View his profile:by clicking on this specific option in his
menu

- * Cancel his appointments:by viewing his appointments and removing them
from the system 

- * change his password _**if needs be, by going to this option and
feeling in the necessary details.

 - * And log out
